## tl;dr
This isn't a science project, it's just a telegram wallet project. This doc will outline the functionality we intend to include in the wallet, the team, and the structure of the private sale opportunity.

## functionality
In short, this is a telegram bot-based wallet, where you control your private keys, aimed with a featureset aimed towards degen-style trading. Key networks supported are
 - ETH
 - BNB
 - SOL
 - MATIC (Polygon)
 - AVA
 - TON
 - ARB
 - BASE
 - BLAST

It aims to be better than other market competitors by providing user features like:
 - Supporting more degen chains
 - "L1 to L2 to L3" transfers.
 - Bridging between degen chains.
 - Integrated anonymous transfers
 - LP + Aping.

It also aims to differentiate by allowing dev focused macro actions like 
 - Offering simplified and streamlined multi-transfers
 - "Token Scattering."

 
6)automatic scattering of tokens for wallets that reach x% of supply.  In example.  I accidently ape 10% of the supply of some random degen on sol.  I need to tokens to be quickly scattered to 5 wallets 2% each

7)combine like token to 1 wallet handy for example when aping multiple max wallets on a private sale

8)also short cuts to trading bots(could be a door to more partnerships as well)

Like let's say deployer wallet has 80% of the supply

And the dev wants to airdrop private sales to help hide the airdrops the dev will send 80% of the supply to 4 wallets 20% in a l1 transfer.  

Next l2 transfer would be 10% spread across 8 wallets.

L3 transfer would be however many spread out across 50+ wallets to private salers
